# Application Architecture, MVC Design Pattern

**1.** What are the Pillars of Object Oriented Programming (`OOP`)?
<!-- enter you answer in the space below -->
```
encapsulation, inheritance, and polymorphism
```
**2.** How would you access the `name` of the below object using the `property` variable?
```js
let staff = {
  name: "Tim",
  age: 26,
  job: "Code Monkey"
  }
let property = 'name'
```


```
staff.name
```
**3.** What is Encapsulation?
<!-- enter you answer in the space below -->
```
In object-oriented computer programming (OOP) languages, the notion of encapsulation (or OOP Encapsulation) refers to the bundling of data, along with the methods that operate on that data, into a single unit.

```
**4.** What does the S stand for in the `SOLID` principles?
<!-- enter you answer in the space below -->
```
Single Responsibility Principle
```
**5.** What the difference between a `class` and an instance of a `class`?
<!-- enter you answer in the space below -->
```
A class is a blueprint or prototype from which objects are created. An instance is a single and unique unit of a class.
```
**6.** What is a `Proxy` object?
<!-- enter you answer in the space below -->
```
The Proxy object allows you to create an object that can be used in place of the original object, but which may redefine fundamental Object operations like getting, setting, and defining properties.
```

**7.** What is the purpose of the `MVC` pattern?
<!-- enter you answer in the space below -->
```
It emphasizes a separation between the software's business logic and display. This "separation of concerns" provides for a better division of labor and improved maintenance.
```
**8.** What is the job of the `Controller` in the `MVC` Pattern?
<!-- enter you answer in the space below -->
```
A controller is responsible for controlling the way that a user interacts with an MVC application. 
```

**9.** What is the job of the `Service` in `MVC`?
<!-- enter you answer in the space below -->
```
 Methods to perform operations with one or more models
```
**10.** What is the job of the `Model` in `MVC`?
<!-- enter you answer in the space below -->
```
To demonstrate how the data should look

The Model is the part of MVC which implements the domain logic. In simple terms, this logic is used to handle the data passed between the database and the user interface (UI).

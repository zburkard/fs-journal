# MVC

This stuff is hard, gonna need to get some reps in.
write vue in pages and components

each vue component is made up of three parts
the template (the html)
the script (javascript)
the style (css styling)

if it doesnt work on first try, run nmp i

homepage.vue is where the reactivity reference for clicker is located

v-for="" is basically a foreach in vue


Micks rules of vue: 
1. for the template to access data in the script it must be in the return
2. for the reactivity to take place. you must use vue's reactive stuff

# Bootstrap
container is top level (continer, container-fluid)
next is row (<section class="row bg-info"> row </section>)
row is display flex
rows contain columns
columns contain content
columns can be sized 1-12 (col-1)
built in justify-content ("justify-content-center")

Useful snippets:
text-center text-danger
rounded, shadow
bg-light bg-dark bg-primary

justify content (left and right)
align-items (up and down)
//NOTE - tag.class shorthand
for example- div.col-6.bg-dark 

infix is for that screen size or larger
A normal font weight (400 or 500 depending on the font) for most text
A heavier font weight (600 or 700) for text you want to emphasize

This can be confusing, but align-content determines the spacing between lines, while align-items determines how the items as a whole are aligned within the container. When there is only one line, align-content has no effect.

# MVC
Model View Controller

"View" is the html representation of the data in the app

"Controller" takes in actions from the user and draws data to the DOM

"Service" is where the business logic is held. (Anything that modifies the data)

"Appstate" Single Source of Truth or where all the apps data will be stored

"Model" is the blueprint of what the data in the appstate will look like

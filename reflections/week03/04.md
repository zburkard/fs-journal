> **ðŸ“– [The Observer Pattern](https://codeworksacademy.com/fs-student-guide/resources/wk3/04-Observer-Pattern)**

## Questions

1. What problems does the Observer Pattern seek to solve?

You need a way to update parts of a page in response to certain events, with the data these provide.

2. What are the three mechanisms of the observer pattern?

Subcribe, Unsubscribe, Broadcast

3. Review the code generated from the bcw-template and reflect on the proxy objects from yesterday, and your understanding of the observer pattern today. With this knowledge, explain how the magic of the bcw-template uses these two concepts to manage and update the dom.

It allows us to use a number of utilities that are pre built as well as pre structures the MVC model so the Observer Pattern is easier to implement.

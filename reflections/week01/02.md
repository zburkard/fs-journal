## Questions

1. What is a Pseudo-Class and what are some of the most common ones you think you will use?
A pseudo-class is a selector that selects elements that are in a specific state. I think I can see myself using :hover quite a bit.

2. What is Specificity and how might you use it to your benefit?
It's a rule built into css to determine which rule should be applied. You can use specificity to make sure that the right styles are applied and to have multiple classes on elements.

3. What problems do you think you could run into if you over-utilized the !important feature?
If everything is important you cant determine specificity, so you'd have a bunch of stuff at the same specificity level.

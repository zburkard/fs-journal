# Weekly Reflection
This reflection is an open format, so it can be whatever you like. Take this opportunity to write a bit on some of the things you have learned this week, or some of the things that you are still struggling with, identify some challenges you had at the beginning of the week that you were able to overcome, or just generally how you are feeling at this point in the course.

## Prompts
- What went well this week?
Pretty much everything, I feel like I am progressing well and learning a lot.
- What did you learn as a shock or suprise?
Bootstrap came as a suprise as to how much easier it was for me to learn than flexbox.
- What are you struggling with?
I was struggling with git, and github, but I think I got it figured out. Still just need to learn more about how everything works when you commit from vs code
- What would you count as a victory?
I finished my checkpoint to my satisfaction before I left on friday. It felt good to apply what I had learned and actually feel like I was comfortable doing the work.

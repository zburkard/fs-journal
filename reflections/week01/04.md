## Questions

Wireframes keep the concept user-focused and clarify and define website features.

Low-fidelity helps you get a general idea of how things will be layed out. High-Fidelity helps you get a good idea for how they want each element of the webpage designed.

3. Do you think wire-frames are worth the Time, Energy, and Effort that they require? Why or Why not?
Yes, its very nice to have a plan and an end goal. I go through a lot of trial and error but its always better to "measure twice and cut once".

## Questions

1. What does REST stand for, and in simple terms what does it mean?

REST stands for REpresentational State Transfer.
It means when a RESTful API is called, the server will transfer to the client a representation of the state of the requested resource.

2. What does Stateless mean?

Stateless means the server does not remember anything about the user who uses the API.

3. What URL pattern is used when writing a RESTful API?

I dont understand this question, and nowhere in the reading does it talk about URL patterns.

In order for an API to be RESTful, it has to adhere to 6 constraints:

Uniform interface
Client â€” server separation
Stateless
Layered system
Cacheable
Code-on-demand

## Questions

1. What are the three states of a `Promise`?

Pending: Initial State, before the Promise succeeds or fails
Resolved: Completed Promise
Rejected: Failed Promise

2. How do `promise`s seek to resolve the issues of "callback hell"?

when there are multiple async operations, you can find yourself in callback hell.
Promises can be chained together and we can attach callbacks rather than passing them, making your code a lot cleaner.

3. What is the difference between `.then()` and `.catch()`?

.then is used for resolved promises
.catch is used for rejected promises

I tried to implement more code documentation.

2. What went well this week?

Checkpoint went well.

3. What would you do differently?

I would have worked more on the back end tuesday night but this week went pretty smooth. I need to pay attention to my destructive actions and make sure they are going through a Pop.confirm().

2. What are some benefits of Pair Programming?

Pair programming enables teams to naturally share information and spread knowledge among members. With sessions focused on communication and shared goals, it benefits teams as they can achieve collective code ownership and highly decrease the bus factor.

3. What are some drawbacks to Pair Programming?

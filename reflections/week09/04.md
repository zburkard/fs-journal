## Questions

1. What is an SSL certificate?

An SSL certificate is a digital certificate that authenticates a website's identity and enables an encrypted connection.

2. What are the different types of certificates? What are they used for?

EV - An EV SSL certificate can be obtained by any business, and it should be a priority especially for those that need identity assurance. For instance, if your website processes web payments or collects data, youâ€™d want to get this certificate.
OV - . Organization Validated (OV) SSL certificates offer a medium level of encryption and are obtained in two steps. First, the CA would verify who owns the domain and if the organization is operating legally.
DV- The Domain Validation (DV) certificate offers a low level of encryption shown as a green padlock next to the URL in the address bar. This is the quickest validation you can receive, and youâ€™ll only need a few company documents to apply.
Wildcard - Wildcard SSLs ensure that if you buy a certificate for one domain, you can use that same certificate for subdomains.
UCC - Also known as Multi-domain SSL certificates, Unified Communications certificates (UCCs) allow multiple domain names to be on the same certificate. UCCs were created to bridge communication between a single server and browser but have since expanded to include multiple domain names by the same owner.
Single Domain - A Single Domain SSL protects one domain. The thing to remember about this certificate is that you canâ€™t use it to protect subdomains or a completely different domain.

3. What are some benefits of using SSL certificates?

An SSL is security technology. Itâ€™s a protocol for servers and web browsers that makes sure that data passed between the two are private. This is done using an encrypted link that connects the server and browser.

Companies that request personal information from a user, such as an email address or payment information, should have SSL certificates on their website. Having one means that the details you are collecting are private and ensures the customer that when they see that padlock and https://, their privacy is safe.

## Questions

Write a review and reflection of your experiences in this course, as this is the last lecture before your `final project`, what are your concerns, how do you plan to manage your time, what have you enjoyed most about the course up to this point.

I have had a positive experience in the course, I have enjoyed learning about something that I am actually interested in. I am going to try and get a big chunk of work done over the weekend so that my week is not as stressful.

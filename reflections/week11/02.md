## Questions

1. What is the difference between a `primary key` and a `foreign key`

A primary key generally focuses on the uniqueness of the table. It assures the value in the specific column is unique. A foreign key is generally used to build a relationship between the two tables.

2. What is an `Alias`?

Type aliasing is a little known feature for C# and it comes in handy when you would like to alias a specific method or class from a namespace for the sake of clarity.

3. Demonstrate how you would query a join statement that would get all of a doctors patients from the following collections:

```SQL
CREATE TABLE doctors (
  id INT NOT NULL AUTO_INCREMENT,
  -- CODE OMITTED
  PRIMARY KEY (id)
)

CREATE TABLE patients (
  id INT NOT NULL AUTO_INCREMENT,
  -- CODE OMITTED
  PRIMARY KEY (id)
)

CREATE TABLE doctors (
  id INT NOT NULL AUTO_INCREMENT,
  doctorId INT NOT NULL,
  patientId INT NOT NULL,

  FOREIGN KEY (doctorId)
    REFERENCES doctors(id),
  FOREIGN KEY (patientId)
    REFERENCES patients(id),
)

```
SELECT p.*
FROM doctors d
  JOIN patient_doctor pd ON d.id = pd.doctorId
  JOIN patients p ON pd.patientId = p.id
WHERE d.id = @id

## Questions

1. What is SQL injection?

SQL Injection is a type of security vulnerability that occurs when user input is not properly validated and is used to dynamically build a SQL query. 

2. What are 3 methods SQL injection can be done by?

Tautologies: An attacker can manipulate a query's condition to always evaluate to true, bypassing any validation or authorization checks.

Union Selects: An attacker can use the UNION operator to append their own malicious SELECT statement to the end of a query and retrieve sensitive data from the database.

Blind Injection: An attacker can cause a query to behave differently based on the structure of the data returned, for example, by using conditional statements in the injected SQL code, even though the attacker cannot see the result of the query. This is known as blind SQL injection.

3. How can we detect and sanitize SQL injection attacks?

Input Validation: Validate and sanitize all user input before using it in a SQL query. This includes checking for unexpected characters, strings, or keywords that could potentially indicate an injection attack.

Use Prepared Statements: Use prepared statements (also known as parameterized queries) instead of dynamically building SQL queries with string concatenation. Prepared statements separate the data from the query, and automatically escape special characters, providing a strong layer of protection against injection attacks.

Escaping: Escaping user input by properly escaping special characters in the input string can prevent injection attacks. This can help ensure that the data being passed to the database is treated as data, and not as part of the SQL query.

Limited Privileges: Limit the privileges of the database user account to the minimum necessary to perform its functions. This reduces the impact of an injection attack, and makes it more difficult for the attacker to access sensitive data or make changes to the database.

Logging: Keep detailed logs of all database activities, including failed attempts, to help detect potential injection attacks and respond quickly.

Regular Security Audits: Regularly perform security audits to identify and address potential vulnerabilities in your code, including SQL injection attacks.

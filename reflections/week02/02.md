## Questions

1. What are the three ways to syntactically write a function? What are the differences in how the function acts (if any)?
A Function Declaration defines a named function. When using function declarations, the function definition is hoisted, thus allowing the function to be used before it is defined.
Ex: function nameFunc(parameters){statements}

A Function Expressions defines a named or anonymous function. An anonymous function is a function that has no name. Function Expressions are not hoisted, and therefore cannot be used before they are defined. Ex: let name = function(parameters){statements}

An Arrow Function Expression is a shorter syntax for writing function expressions. Arrow functions do not create their own "this" value.
Ex: let name = (parameters) => {statements}

2. What is the difference between Parameters and Arguments?
Parameters are used when defining a function and arguments are the values the function receives from each parameter when the function is executed.

3. What are higher order functions? Can you provide an example?

When a function accepts another function as a parameter, or returns a function, it is called a higher-order function.

I need to practice my sort functions more, I have been using a lot of find. It would be good to get more "reps" in with sort and filter.

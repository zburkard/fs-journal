## Questions

1. What is Scope ?

Scope is basically "where" variables are available for use.

2. What is Hoisting ?

Hoisting is a JavaScript mechanism where variables and function declarations are moved to the top of their scope before code execution.

3. In what cases might you use let vs const vs var?

I would try to avoid using var, because of the possible bugs it could cause later in my code. 
I would use const if I wanted a variable to have a value that I couldn't reassign.
I would use let in basically every other situation.

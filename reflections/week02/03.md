## Questions

1. What are the main ways to write information to the console? Why/when should you use each style.

console.log('') you can print to see when and where something is happening or not happening.

Error messages will also print to the console. Syntax, reference, or type errors.

2. Which tab allows you to see the breakdown of HTML/CSS and how can this tab be useful when debugging HTML?
Elements tab will allow you to see the breakdown of HTML/CSS 
This can be useful when debugging because you can see how the specificity of your CSS is applying to each element as well as actively edit any styling you may have gotten wrong.

3. Outside of writing everything to the console, what is a better way to debug your code?

Breakpoints are a great way to debug. You can step through your function as it runs and see any possible problems.

Identify at least 1 takeaway from today's assignment

# Final Reflection

The Final Week, The Final day of Course Work. How did it go? Are you ready for career week?

## Prompts

- What went well this week?

I think I got a lot done over the weekend so the backend went really smooth, I timeboxed well enough to get a passing grade on the final,
and I got some career services things straightened out for monday.

- What did you learn as a shock or surprise?

I am better at C# than I thought I would be, and I am worse at styling and following a figma than I had thought.

- What are you struggling with?

SQL statements, data relationships, following a figma with correct css.

- What would you count as a victory?

Passed the final and timeboxed fairly well.

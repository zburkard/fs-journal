# Daily Reflection

Two full days in! Did you make the progress you were hoping for yesterday and today? How are you working? Client -> Server, focusing only on the server for now?

## Prompts

- How is today going?
  Good, just trying to get my front end finished up so that I can work out any bugs and get graded
- Are you managing your stress?
  Pretty well, I feel like I am finishing in a decent time
- What has you most worried?
  Making sure my styling works with functionality

## Questions

1. What is the purpose of a Query String?

A query string allows you to pass information to and from a website by simply adding, or ‚Äúappending,‚Äù that information to the end of a URL. 

2. What is the format of a query parameter? How does it start? How do you distinguish between one parameter and the next?

The query string portion of a URL is the part of the URL after the question mark.  If your query string has multiple query parameters, they‚Äôre separated by &.

3. When do you think Query parameters would be helpful when writing your server?

Data can be passed into any request using a query string. Once passed, the data can be captured in node from the request object. This data can be used for anything you like, from a filter, to adding additional context to a request.

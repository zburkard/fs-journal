## Questions

1. In a SQL table, what is the difference between information in a row and information in a column?

 Data in a row contains information that describes a single entity, while data in a column describes a field of information all entities possess.

2. Demonstrate the basic structure for creating a new table called `characters` with the values `name, age, description` as strings, and an `int` id.

CREATE NEW TABLE characters(
  id int NOT NULL,
  name string,
  age string,
  description string,
)

3. What are the difference between the following statements: 
```sql
DELETE FROM table_name;
DROP TABLE table_name;

Delete you are deleting the items in the table,
Drop you are deleting the entire table.
```
